  <h1>Welcome to Thailand, Irdina and Family!</h1>
  <p>Dear Irdina,</p>
  <p>On this special day of your move to Thailand, I can't help but express my deepest feelings. You are not only a dear friend but also the one who has captured my heart. Even you didn't like me or love me but it's okay, I just express my feeling. As you embark on this new adventure, please know that my love for you knows no bounds.</p>
  <p>Thailand, with its enchanting beauty, can't compare to the radiance you bring into my life. Your smile brightens even the darkest days, and your presence fills my world with joy. Though it saddens me that we'll be apart, the thought of your happiness in Thailand brings me comfort.</p>
  <p>May this journey be a stepping stone towards our future, where we can create our own magical moments together. Every sunrise and sunset you witness in Thailand, every touch of the gentle breeze, I hope they remind you of my unwavering affection.</p>
  <p>Distance may separate us physically, but our hearts are intertwined, beating in sync across borders. As you explore the wonders of Thailand, remember that I'm with you in spirit, cheering you on from afar.</p>
  <p>May this chapter in your life be filled with endless opportunities, unforgettable experiences, and love that surpasses all boundaries. Cherish every moment, and let the beauty of Thailand be a backdrop to our love story.</p>
